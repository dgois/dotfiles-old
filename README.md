# Denis .dotfiles

I have never had listen about dotfiles until see one from a coworker in my company, since I realized the fantastic tool it is I decided to study and create my own.

Good reference for me was the article: https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.1tpaxymz7

As well as the dotfiles inside it:

* https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
* https://github.com/orrsella/dotfiles

I will keep learn and develop my dotfiles, so fell free and take your own risk in copy it.
